# Diabetes-Prediction
## Tools And Technologies Used : 
-Python
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Scikit-learn 
-Matplotlib 
-Seaborn
## Project Description :
Developed an end-to-end machine learning project to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical and lifestyle attributes. The project involved collecting and preprocessing healthcare data, handling missing values, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
Multiple machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate model for prediction. Model performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. The final model provides reliable predictions that can assist in early detection and decision-making.
This project demonstrates my ability to apply data analytics and machine learning techniques to real-world healthcare problems, transforming raw data into actionable insights and predictive solutions.
